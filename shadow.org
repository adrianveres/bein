* To Do:
** Browser for repository
*** What widget set to do it in?  Or do it with a web browser?
** Add configuration files
*** Is there a good Python library for this?
*** Formulate a search policy for finding the files
** LSF nonblocking executions
*** Try PyLSF on the cluster.  Does it work?
*** Figure out how to wait on a process and get its stdout and stderr, and return code
*** Write lsf() on program like nonblocking, but calling PyLSF
** Bind samtools and more programs in
*** Try a couple things for return values from programs.
*** Go through the program library I wrote for Scheme bein, and translate stuff over.
** Write a manual
*** Outline, rough draft, edit
** Document the code
*** Add docstrings to everything, rearrange it for clarity.  Write some overall structure comments.
** Write unit tests
*** How do I unit test this?  Set up the mocks...
** Add immutability constraints to MiniLIMS
*** Pull these from the SQL file I dumped out of the Scheme bein database
** Add copy, delete, and import operations to MiniLIMS
*** Just a few operations.
** Add search and query operations to MiniLIMS
*** How do I want to do this?  Return a list of file ids?  Search based on text lookups in description and filename.  Search by date and time.  Borrow the form from Scheme bein.
