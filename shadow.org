* To Do:
** TODO LSF nonblocking executions
*** TODO Get sqlite3 library for Python working on cluster
Waiting for Arnaud to install sqlite-devel-3.3.6 RPM, then I'll have to recompile Python.
*** DONE Change -c to -cwd in lsf() function on program (it's set to -c to use my mock bsub right now)
*** Try PyLSF on the cluster.  Does it work?
Doesn't work with LSF 7, only 6.2.  VITAL-IT uses 7.  Just use bsub directly.

bsub command line options:
-cwd "current_working_directory"
-o out_file sends stdout to out_file
-e err_file sends stderr to err_file
-K waits for job to complete
-r rerun job if host goes does

*** Write lsf() on program like nonblocking, but calling PyLSF
** DONE Add search and query operations to MiniLIMS
*** How do I want to do this?  Return a list of file ids?  Search based on text lookups in description and filename.  Search by date and time.  Borrow the form from Scheme bein.
Wrote search_files.  Now executions?
*** DONE search_executions - checks description and arguments of each program.
** DONE Add copy, delete, and import operations to MiniLIMS
*** Just a few operations.
*** DONE Write copy file method for MiniLIMS
*** DONE Write delete file method for MiniLIMS
*** DONE Write delete execution method for MiniLIMS
*** DONE Write import file method for MiniLIMS
** Add configuration files
*** Is there a good Python library for this?
*** Formulate a search policy for finding the files
** Bind samtools and more programs in
*** Try a couple things for return values from programs.
*** Go through the program library I wrote for Scheme bein, and translate stuff over.
** Write a manual
*** Outline, rough draft, edit
** Document the code
*** Add docstrings to everything, rearrange it for clarity.  Write some overall structure comments.
** Write unit tests
*** How do I unit test this?  Set up the mocks...
** DONE Add immutability constraints to MiniLIMS
*** Pull these from the SQL file I dumped out of the Scheme bein database



* Nongoals:
** Browser for repository
Widgets sets appear to be a pain.  Can we do it in a local way to a web browser?
Doing it with Tkinter on VITAL-IT appears to be horribly painful.
Forget this stage.  Make the guts work, and let people query the LIMS as they want.
*** What widget set to do it in?  Or do it with a web browser?
